<!--  Version 1.0-0

      This version of the slides is taken directly from Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's lecture slides
      posted on OpenIntro.org in PDF (LaTeX) format, and moved to Rmd. Topic is Chapter 2-1 and 2-2
      of OpenIntro Statistics, Probability, introduction through Bayes'.
      
      A large part of the HTML/CSS formatting is janky, and could be cleaned up. Feel free to issue a 
      pull request if you love HTML and CSS and want to fix this up.

## Conditional Probability and Venn Diagrams

I've shown you how to setup a tree diagram for branching probability problems, but we haven't reviewed
the other type of diagram used: **Venn Diagrams**.

This will be best shown via example.

## Example

Consider a survey asking people their opinion of fast food establishments. In the survey,
56\% of people say they would eat at McDonald's, 72\% of people say they would eat at Wendy's,
and of the people who say they eat at Wendy's, 65\% say they would also eat at McDonald's.

**Question 1**: what is the probability a randomly selected person would eat at **both** Wendy's
and McDonald's?

## Example



## Example

**Question 2**: what is the conditional probability that if a randomly selected person would eat
at McDonald's that they would also eat at Wendy's?


## Example

**Question 3**: given that we know that the person selected would eat at Wendy's, what is the probability
they would **not** eat at McDonald's?

## And now ...

WeBWorK Practice 3 - let's solve some problems!
